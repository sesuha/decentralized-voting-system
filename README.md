## Decentralized Voting System

A decentralized voting system built on Ethereum using Solidity. This project allows for transparent, tamper-proof voting where participants can cast their votes on a blockchain, ensuring integrity and fairness.

### Features

- **Smart Contract-Based Voting**: The entire voting process is handled by a smart contract, ensuring no tampering or manipulation.
- **Voter Registration**: Only registered voters can participate in the election.
- **Candidate Registration**: Candidates can be added, and their votes are tracked automatically.
- **One Vote Per Voter**: Each registered voter can only cast one vote.
- **Transparent Results**: Votes are tallied on-chain, and anyone can view the current vote count.
- **Owner Control**: Only the owner (deployer) of the contract can start and stop the election, register voters and candidates, and announce the winner.
